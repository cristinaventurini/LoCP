# LoCP
Assignments and final projects for the course of *Laboratory of Computational Physics (Mod. A and B)* by professors Marco Baiesi and Marco Zanetti, first year master course in Physics of Data, Padua.


***Assignments*** <br>
Collection of assignments undertaken during both module A and B. <br>
The programming language is Python and the topics differ as follows: <br>

- MOD A: basics of Python, including the main libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and some Numba, as well as some tutorials on implementing algorithms and Monte Carlo simulations in Python. <br>
- MOD B: Machine Learning applications in Python, weekly assignments covering the following topics: <br>
  1 - Gradient Descent
  2 - Deep Neural Network
  3 - Convolutional Neural Network
  3b - Competition on CNN
  4 - tSNE and DBSCAN
  5 - RBM

***Final projects*** <br>
Both for the MOD A and the MOD B part there were final projects to wrap up the course.<br>
For MOD A, together with my group, we implemented a mean timer techinque to reconstruct the tracks of muons passing through a calorimeter, making use of the Pandas library. <br>

For MOD B, there were two final projects, always carried out in groups: 
- The first one consisted in writing a mock scientific paper regarding one of the topics covered during the weekly assignments, for us tSNE and DBSCAN. 
- The second was a project supervised by professor Marco Zanetti and Dr. Alberto Zucchetta, in which we worked with data coming from CMS with the goal of setting an upper limit to the branching fraction of FCNC (flavour changing neutral currents) decay of <span style="text-decoration: overline">t</span> → 𝐻𝑞 + 𝑊𝑏 → 𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑝𝑡𝑜𝑛
